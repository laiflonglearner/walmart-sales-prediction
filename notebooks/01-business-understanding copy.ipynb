    "### Retail Environment (2010-2013)\n",
    "\n",
    "The period from 2010 to 2013 was marked by a slow but steady recovery from the 2008 financial crisis (GAP TO FILL: article/research about 2008 financial crisis). Consumer confidence was gradually improving, and spending was on the rise, though still cautious. During these years, the retail industry was predominantly driven by in-store sales, as e-commerce was still in its infancy. Retailers like Walmart focused heavily on optimizing their physical stores, improving customer experience, and maintaining competitive pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walmart's Strategic Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "Walmart continued to dominate the retail sector with its \"Everyday Low Prices\" (EDLP) strategy, which aimed to attract cost-conscious consumers by keeping prices consistently low (GAP TO FILL: research about Walmart strategy & performance during 2008-2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Scope & Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Walmart sales datasets were obtained from Kaggle and have limited time range starting from 2010 until 2013. The dataset does not include information on the rise of e-commerce, which became more prominent in the following years. So the insights and recommendations derived from this project will be based on the Walmart's sales performance during this period, with a particular emphasis on in-store sales trends and factors affecting consumer behavior."
